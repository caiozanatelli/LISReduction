# LISReduction

This implementation solves a classical problem with a LIS reduction. A street with odd numbers in one side and even numbers in the other is given. On such street there are houses and bars, and the owner of each bar lives in a house located in the opposite street. As the world cup arrives, the task is to find the maximum number of flags that can be connected from a bar to its owner's home with no crossing flags and only one flag may be connected to each single pair. In order to explore the problem, three solutions were implemented: backtracking, greedy and dynamic programming.
